# Assured assessment: Graphical analysis

Analysing DAGs generated by domain experts, along with details of the modelling protocol for eliciting knowledge from domain experts with the use of causal diagrams.

## Modelling Protocol and support materials

The **modelling protocol** is in a word doc in this repo - but it does include questions / components for this particular piece of research in addition to the guidelines for running causal modelling sessions with domain experts. There is also a .pdf file of "dag-dialogue-prompts.pdf" that offer suggestions for the facilitator based on sub-graphs in the current graphical model. 

## DAG analysis and results

All analysis in the .qmd file. 
There is a nice html render of it (below) but unfortunately the anonymise github machinery doesn't let it render well. 

View [the analysis here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://anonymous.4open.science/r/assured-assessment-dag-analysis-531D/blob/main/elicited-DAG-analysis.html) - although the html preview doesn't seem to work with the anonymised repo.

Paper to come :)
